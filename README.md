## Definition of Terms ðŸ‘“

**Entity Framework core (EF CORE) :**
EF provides the capability to interact with data from relational databases using an object model that maps directly to the business objects (or domain objects) in your application. For example, rather than treating a batch of data as a collection of rows and columns, you can operate on a collection of strongly typed objects termed entities. These entities are held in specialized collection classes that are LINQ aware, enabling data access operations using C# code.
